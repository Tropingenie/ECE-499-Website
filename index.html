<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Need for the project, i.e. what is the social issue the project is trying to address. (remove this line when finalized)
<br>
<br>This project was suggested by <a href="https://nozzleninja.com">Nozzle Ninja</a>, an agricultural supply retailer in Stettler, Alberta.<br>
<br>Nozzle Ninja sought to create a reduced cost device that interfaces between an ISOBUS display<br>
and the nozzles of a tow-behind sprayer. Current per-nozzle control systems can retail around
<br>$12,000, and by creating a lower-cost alternative, enables farmers to make their operations
<br>more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Further, the device could serve to lower the
<br>barrier of entry to farming by allowing new farmers to access what previously was a high cost, 
<br>sophisticated system.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>How is the problem addressed by the team. (remove this line when finalized)
<br>
<br>To create a prototype, the team opted for a two unit solution. One unit would be the command unit,
<br>which stands in for a high cost ISOBUS display, while the other unit would be the actuator unit, responsible
<br>for actuating the nozzles. All design documents, including circuit schematics, PCB designs, and software
<br>can be found on the project <a href="https://github.com/Tropingenie/ECE-499">GitHub</a>.
<br><br>***insert hardware design blurb here***
<br><br> The software of the prototype was written using C++ using C-style linkages. C++ was chosen as the language
<br>of implementation because of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Agriculture/AgIsoStack-plus-plus">AgIsoStack++</a>, the programming library that was chosen to implement ISOBUS
<br>communication. The command unit software was responsible for handling user input from a rotary encoder/button
<br>combo, while the actuator unit software was responsible for actuating the connected nozzles.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Some significant results. (remove this line when finalized)
<br>
<br>The final prototype provides a good starting point for a more fully featured future design, despite some setbacks
<br>during the prototyping process.
<br><br>One issue encountered during prototyping was the unfortunate failure of one of the Canbus modules, which was
<br>going to be used in order to implement ISOBUS communication. Due to time constraints, a replacement was not
<br>sourced, and the team instead pivoted to using UART communication between the two units.
<br><br>Another issue encountered was the rotary encoder, a pivotal part of the user interface, displaying inaccurate and
<br>unexpected behaviour. After some investigation, the team uncovered the cause of the behaviour. Unable to correct
<br>this behaviour in hardware, a software rewrite for the command unit was initiated, which was successful in surpressing
<br>the unintended behaviour.
<br><br>The final prototype met the original specifications of having the command and actuator unit communicate with
<br>each other, as well as the having the actuator unit act on commands sent from the command unit. Although no
<br>nozzles were attached to the actuator unit, LEDs were used to simulate the actuating of nozzles.
